Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Mainly the values of the first countries with a chance of winning and the last ones.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: From the 10000th simulation, the values began to follow a pattern.
